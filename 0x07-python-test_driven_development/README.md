0x07. Python - Test-driven development
 Why tests are important:
Quality Assurance: Tests ensure that your code behaves as expected. They help catch bugs and issues early in the development process, preventing them from reaching production.

Documentation: Tests serve as a form of documentation for your code. They describe the expected behavior of your functions and classes.

Refactoring: Tests provide a safety net when refactoring code. You can make changes with confidence, knowing that the tests will catch regressions.

Collaboration: Tests make it easier for teams to collaborate. New contributors can understand the intended behavior of the code by reviewing and running the tests.
